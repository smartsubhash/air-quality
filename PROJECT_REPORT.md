- Survey progress tracking with interactive navigation

### 4.3 Data Visualization Dashboard

Comprehensive data visualization tools include:
- Interactive time series charts showing air pollution trends
- Correlation analysis between different pollutants
- Comparative charts (bar, pie, line) for multi-variable analysis
- Heatmaps showing pollution hotspots
- Data tables with filtering and sorting capabilities

### 4.4 Personalized Results and Recommendations

After completing the survey, users receive:
- Analysis of their local air quality situation
- Health risk assessment based on reported symptoms
- Personalized recommendations for reducing exposure
- Comparison with regional and global air quality data

## 5. Database Design

### 5.1 Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with the following key tables:

1. **Users Table**:
   - Primary key: user_id
   - Fields: username, email, password_hash, registration_date

2. **Survey_Responses Table**:
   - Primary key: response_id
   - Foreign key: user_id (references Users table)
   - Fields: multiple survey question responses, submission_date, location_data

3. **Air_Quality_Data Table**:
   - Primary key: reading_id
   - Fields: date, time, multiple pollutant measurements (CO, NOx, PM2.5, etc.), air quality index

### 5.2 Data Sources

The application uses a combination of:
- Historical air quality datasets from environmental monitoring stations
- User-contributed survey data about local conditions
- Real-time data feeds (for future implementation)

## 6. User Interface Design

### 6.1 Home Page

The home page features:
- Dramatic hero section with air pollution imagery
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Information about air quality monitoring
- Navigation to key application sections

### 6.2 Survey Interface

The survey interface includes:
- Step-by-step question progression
- Input validation
- Progress indicator
- Previous/next navigation
- Response saving functionality

### 6.3 Data Visualization Page

The data visualization dashboard provides:
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, pie)
- Interactive controls for data filtering
- Clear visual hierarchy of information
- Responsive design for all device sizes

### 6.4 Results Page

The personalized results page displays:
- Summary of survey responses
- Analysis of local air quality
- Recommendations tailored to the user
- Option to share results

## 7. Implementation Details

### 7.1 Key Algorithms

1. **Air Quality Index (AQI) Calculation**:
   - Conversion of raw pollutant measurements to standardized AQI
   - Categorization into health risk levels

2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Statistical analysis of relationships between different pollutants
   - Seasonal pattern detection

3. **User Similarity Matching**:
   - Grouping users with similar local conditions
   - Recommendation engine based on similar profiles

### 7.2 Security Measures

The application implements several security best practices:
- Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms
- CSRF protection for all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management
- Database query parameterization to prevent SQL injection
